# Noah Keck
### _resume_

I have many skills. :ramen:

Some of them include:

- Nacho Making
- Humor
- And writing markdown files

I am a time-honored member of the boy scout cult.

I have produced several functional games in java.

I enjoy programming and software development.

When I create a real resume, this is where I will put it. Until then this will let me see how well it functions with the website.
