Greenfoot Gold is a side project that I haven't spent much time developing yet. The goal of this project is the take the Greenfoot IDE, and add more tools and functions that provide a much better application for creating Java graphics-based games and simulations.

Greenfoot was of course designed by the same developers of BlueJ to be a simplistic and easy coding environment for students who are taking the first steps towards programming. Thus, Greenfoot Gold should be a completely separate project that is designed with more advanced programming in mind.

The project is obviously limited by the quality of Java's graphics (it's not great) but it could at least have a chance.
