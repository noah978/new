# This is it

I may never use this blog, but I fully intend to. I have hopes to begin development on several different projects, hopefully which will be released to the world. Whether I'll end up distributing applications directly from Github, another website or from an app store, I don't really know.

All in all, this will be a learning experience. For example, just in writing this post, I have learned how Jekyll websites, Sass, HTML, CSS and markdown all work together. This is definitely my first blog post, it's pretty obvious, but with any luck, it may not be my last.
