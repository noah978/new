Hi! My name is Noah Keck, and I enjoy building computers and writing programs.

I have been programming for around 7 years now. I first programmed in MIT's Scratch to learn what procedural thinking was. I have worked on several projects as an independent developer, including Minesweeper and a Sudoku Generator written in java. I built my first high-end PC in 2017 and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Since then I have continued learning about the intricacies of Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

On a more personal level, I am a 18-year-old freshman at Albion College, where I am taking several advanced Computer Science courses and am planning on continuing into a computer engineering program. I have always enjoyed computers to the fullest extent in both their software and hardware. I also actively practice and play the French Horn, enjoy playing video games (especially Nintendo!) and have an over sized game library on Steam.
